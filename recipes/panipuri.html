     <ul>
        <li>2 to 3 potatoes</li>
        <li>1 to 1.5 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon roasted cumin powder</li>
        <li>1 to 1.25 cups water</li>
        <li>3.5 to 4 tablespoons jaggery powder</li>
     </ul>
     <h4>Steps to Prepare :</h4>
     <ol>
        <li>Rinse 1 cup tightly packed coriander leaves, ½ cup tightly packed mint leaves, 2 to 3 green chilies and 1 inch ginger very well in water a few times. Drain all the water.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon tightly packed tamarind and 3.5 to 4 tablespoons jaggery powder or grated jaggery.</li>
        <li>Then add ½ to ¾ cup water. You can add less or more water depending on the consistency you want. But do not add too much water as then the taste and flavor of the spiced water reduces. Also check the taste and if required you can add some more jaggery or salt as required.</li>
